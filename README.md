Q.1. Reverse the linkedlist

Q.2. Find the middle element in a linkedlist

Q.3. Detect Loop in a linkedlist

Q.4. Remove duplicate elements from a sorted linkedlist

Q. 5. Two Sum
Given an array of integer nums and an integer target, returnindices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution,and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Q.7 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
You are given an array of prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on an ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buyone stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell thatstock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction.If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6),profit = 6-1 = 5.


Q. 8. Product of array except self
integer array nums, return an array answer such thatanswer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[I].
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a32-bit integer.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and withoutusing the division operation.
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]


Q.2. Contains Duplicate
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears atleast twice in the array, and return false if every element indistinct.
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
